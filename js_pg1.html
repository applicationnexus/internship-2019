<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div class="par"><p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control strictures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; <br><br><b>For example:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Client-side JavaScript </i> extends the core language by supplying objetcs to control a browser and its DOM.</li><br>
<li><i>Server-side JavaScript</i> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</li>
</ul>
